### Project description    
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts.

### What case are we solving?    
We need to write a program that guesses a number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**  
- The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By “guess” we mean “write a program that guesses the number”.
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality Metric**     
Results are assessed by the average number of attempts per 1000 repetitions

**What are we practice ?**     
Learning to write good Python code


### Brief information about the data
The randit function of the numpy library randomly generates numbers from 1 to 100 in 1000 attempts, and my algorithm tries to guess the hidden number in the least number of attempts

### Stages of working on the project  
Two functions were written: a function for guessing a number and a function for testing the algorithm for guessing a number. By running the second function I got the desired result.

### Results:  
My algorithm guesses the number in an average of 5 attempts.

### Conclusions:  
I consider the results of the algorithm to be satisfactory.
